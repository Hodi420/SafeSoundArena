# Next.js SSR Scaffold

This folder contains the initial structure for a Next.js app, ready for fast server-side rendering (SSR) and migration from a React SPA.

## Structure
- `/pages` — All route-based pages (index, marketplace, etc.)
- `/public` — Static assets (images, icons, etc.)
- `/components` — Reusable UI components
- `/core` — Core game logic
- `/parameters` — Tunable configs and constants
- `/features` — Domain/game features
- `/hooks` — Custom React hooks
- `/services` — API/data providers
- `/store` — Global state
- `/context` — React Context providers
- `/types` — TypeScript types/enums
- `/utils` — Pure helpers

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the dev server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Add your pages and migrate components as needed.
